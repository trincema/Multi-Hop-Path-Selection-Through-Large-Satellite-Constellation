# Multi-Hop-Path-Selection-Through-Large-Satellite-Constellation
The idea for this research project started from Elon Musk's plans to deploy a large constellation of 42.000 satellites, with the main purpose to provide internet access globally. See [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UpsSIMXCmc)
The purpose of this research project is to try to simulate a design for such a SatCom Radio Network System using <a href="https://fr.mathworks.com/help/satcom/index.html" target="_blank">Sattelite Communication Toolbox</a> provided by MATLAB.
